My 4 files are:
1. R document where I scrapped the data from spotify with a client ID and secretd ID I obtained on the web developer API website of Spotify. Those credentials are unique, please do not share.
2. The CSV/Excel document withn the Data Frame
3. The junyper notebook I used to manipulate my data.
4. A Google slides I used for my presententastion.

The future analysis is to predict number of streams (dependant, Y) a song will have based on the features (Independant, X). For this I will work with Linear Regression. Also I will like to see some trends 
if the model works both for male and female pop artist or no.
